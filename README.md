# RecipeTree

Calculate the resources required to run FactoryMod recipes

Built for [CivClassic](http://civclassic.com)

## Usage

Open https://gjum.github.io/RecipeTree/
and select the item quantity that you want to obtain in the end.
The view is now split into two parts:
the items/factories that you will have in the end,
and the factories/items that you need before you start.
If you don't have a factory/item that's listed as required,
you can click the respective buttons next to it
to add its setup/recipe materials to the list of items you need.
The factory you clicked is then marked as obtained,
because it's still available after you're done.
Eventually all the items/factories that are marked as required
are already available to you
or are resources that you can obtain directly.
